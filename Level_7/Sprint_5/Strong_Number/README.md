# Strong Number

For example, 145 is strong, because 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

1 is a strong number, because 1! = 1, so return "STRONG!!!!".
123 is not a strong number, because 1! + 2! + 3! = 9 is not equal to 123, so return "Not Strong !!".
145 is a strong number, because 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145, so return "STRONG!!!!".
150 is not a strong number, because 1! + 5! + 0! = 122 is not equal to 150, so return "Not Strong !!".
